              This chart shows the relationship between global carbon dioxide
              emissions and temperature changes since the year 1880. The CO<sub

              emission represents cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide from
              fossil fuel and industry in the certain region. The temperature
              change represents the change in global mean surface temperature
              caused by greenhouse effect. The data is illustrated with a
              biaxial scatter plot.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the graph, we can see that carbon dioxide emissions have
              shown a significant upward trend over the past 140 years. At the
              beginning of the Industrial Revolution, emissions were very low.
              Growth in emissions was still relatively slow until the mid-20th
              century. In the second half of the 20th century, with the rapid
              development of the global economy, industry and transportation
              scale, carbon dioxide emissions increased sharply.
            </p>
            <p>
              It can also be seen that global temperatures have shown a clear
              upward trend over the past century. Especially in the early 21st
              century, the rate of temperature rise seems to be accelerating,
              further raising concerns about climate change.This trend is
              closely related to the rise in global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions,
              reflecting the impact of CO<sub>2</sub> on climate change.
            </p>
            <p>
              Generally, the chart shows the impact of human activities on
              climate change since the Industrial Revolution, particularly the
              use of fossil fuels and the increase in greenhouse gas emissions
              caused by modern industrialization processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of global climate
              change. It's widely recognized that to avoid the worst impacts of
              climate change, the world needs to urgently reduce emissions. In
              future, the world must reach an agreement about how this
              responsibility is shared between regions, countries, and
              individuals, and take solid actions ASAP.
