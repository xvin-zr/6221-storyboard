            The map shows us Annual CO₂ emissions by country, Per capita CO₂
            emissions and Historical CO₂ emissions by country, which shows us
            the geographical distribution of these emissions. The chart on the
            left shows the corresponding data for several key countries in a
            specific year.

          <p>
            From the mid-18th century to the mid-19th century, with the
            development of the first industrial revolution, due to the vigorous
            development of steam technology and the rapid expansion of the
            number of factories, the UK's CO₂ emissions increased significantly,
            leading the world by far.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the middle of the 19th century, the CO₂ emissions of the EU
            (27) and the United States began to increase. From the late 19th
            century to the early 20th century, with the outbreak of the Second
            Industrial Revolution and the widespread use of electricity, the CO₂
            emissions of the EU (27) and the United States gradually approached
            and surpassed the United Kingdom. For a long time, the United States
            ranked first in the world in emissions, and per capita emissions
            have been ranked first in the world since the beginning of the 20th
            century.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the 20th century, CO₂ emissions have begun to rise around the
            world, especially in China, which has been increasing at a high rate
            since its founding and has become the country with the largest
            emissions in the 21st century.
