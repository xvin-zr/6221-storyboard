          <p>
            To reduce the seriousness of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, coordinated
            global action is needed. Developed nations, like the U.S.A. and UK,
            are historical contributors to emissions, so they have a
            responsibility to not only reduce their own emissions but also
            support developing countries to help them constrain emissions. This
            support can be made in several ways, such as providing funding,
            making collaborative efforts, and helping these economies grow
            sustainably and eco-friendly without repeating the environmental
            costs of the past.
          </p>

          <p>
            Public engagement is also critical; our individual actions and
            behaviors significantly impact overall emissions. The first step is
            to raise public awareness. Then, in our daily lives, we can buy more
            green products, take public transport, and use fewer plastic items.
            These sustainable choices can make a real difference.
