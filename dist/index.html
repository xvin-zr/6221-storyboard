          <p>
            Human activities, especially the emission of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>),
            are important factors that cause global climate change. This issue
            has emerged as one of the most pressing challenges of our time. The
            primary source of global warming is the accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub>
            emissions in the atmosphere, which traps heat and causes the Earth's
            temperature to rise. Consequently, this threatens natural
            ecosystems, human health, food security, and economic stability.
          </p>

          <p>
            The aim of this storyboard is to provide a visual and data-supported
            visualization of how global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have contributed to rising
            global temperatures. The storyboard breaks down the issue into four
            interconnected sections:
          </p>

          <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
            <li>The historical rise in global temperatures</li>
            <li>The role of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in this rise</li>
            <li>The comparative emissions of various countries</li>
            <li>The main sectors responsible for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Through this exploration, the goal is not only to highlight the
            seriousness of the issue but also to offer some insights for
            reducing emissions.
