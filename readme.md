## Preview

Use `Live Server` or others servers to open `index.html` in `dist` directory to view the storyboard. (Make sure to open `dist` directory directly as the root directory to avoid path issues)

## Source Code

The bundled code in `dist` may be difficult to read, but all human-readable source files are organized as follows:

- Source code: `src`
- Datasets: `src/data`
- HTML pages: `storyboard`
